# AI/ML Club - Block Evolution

**Academic Year:** 2025-2026 Fall Semester  
**Project Duration:** September 2025 - December 2025

## Project Description

Use a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of graphs of neural network layers to achieve the lowest training loss in a limited amount of time

**Key Objectives:**
- Represent a graph of neural network layers as a gene-like string that remains valid under simple mutation and crossover operations
- Apply a genetic algorithm to neural network structure discovery
- Find an interesting alternative structure a human expert would be unlikely to guess for learning some dataset
